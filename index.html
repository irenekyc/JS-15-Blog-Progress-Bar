        <p> This is an interesting feature for a blog post to have. Some argue that it does not enhance any user experience. Instead it is distracting.</p>

        <p> To me, I think it is a pretty cool feature, so that the users know what to expect in the blog. I personally appreciate this feature. Because I know what I have to expect when I am reading the blog</p>
      
        <p> So I have decided to learn how to code it. From this coding challenge, I have learned about some cool javascript properties, offsetTop, height, scroll Y etc.</p>
        <p> Besides, did you notice that the blog title stick on the top of the window when you scroll down to the content?</p>
        <p> It is pretty cool! Isn't it?</p>
